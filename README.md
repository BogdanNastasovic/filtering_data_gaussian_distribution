Project focuses on analyzing data collected from Stack Overflow, particularly from their annual surveys. The primary objectives were to explore the distribution of developers based on their work environment (office, remote, or hybrid), investigate the relationship between the age of developers and a Gaussian normal distribution, and finally, understand the motivations behind developers engaging in coding activities.

1. Data Collection - We utilized data from Stack Overflow's annual survey as the primary source. All comments within the project are written in Serbian.

2. Data Preprocessing - We performed data preprocessing tasks, including dropping irrelevant columns and renaming column headers. This ensures that the analysis is focused on the key aspects relevant to our research goals. A defined filter was created and applied to the dataset. This filter allowed us to extract and work with the specific data points essential for our analysis.

3. Working environments - The project aims to visually represent the distribution of developers working in various environments. This is illustrated through a pie chart, providing insights into the prevalence of office, remote, and hybrid work setups among developers.

4. Age Distribution Analysis - An exploration of the connection between the age of developers and a Gaussian normal distribution is a core aspect of the project. Visualizations are employed to convey this relationship, helping to identify patterns and trends within the data.

5. Motivations for Coding - The project concludes horizontal bar graph, which highlights the reasons developers engage in coding activities.
